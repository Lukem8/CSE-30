	Algorithm BinarySearch(string* arr, array_size, k)
		arr is a string array of size array_size
		k is key we are searching for
		low = 0, high = array_size
		mid = (high + low) /2 
		while mid != k
			if mid > k
				low = mid+1
				continue
			if mid < k
				high = mid-1
				continue
			if mid == k 
				return mid
